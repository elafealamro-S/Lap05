# Lab 05 – Loops

## 1. Objective
The purpose of this Lab is to familiarize students with using:
1. The while loop
2. The for loop
3. The do-while loop

## 2. Lab Learning Outcomes (LLO)
By completion of the lab the students should be able to:
1. Apply a while loop to solve a given problem
2. Apply a for loop to solve a given problem
3. Apply a do-while loop to solve a given problem

## 3. Theory Review – while, for and do-while Loops
### While Loop
```java
int x = 0;
while (x < 10) {
    x++;
    System.out.println("This while loop will print 10 times");
}
